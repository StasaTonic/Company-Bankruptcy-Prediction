A project for the course Elements of Financial Mathematics. Given the common occurrence of data imbalance in financial datasets, techniques such as SMOTE, undersampling, and oversampling were used to address this. Furthermore, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and UMAP were applied to reduce the number of features and capture essential information. Algorithms such as SVM, XGBoost, and Random Forest were employed for classification.\
